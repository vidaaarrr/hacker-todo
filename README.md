## 🧠 How It Works

When you run the program, you’ll see two sections:

- `Not Done` → active tasks
- `Done` → completed tasks

Use the following commands:

```bash
add task name         # Add a new task
tick task name        # Mark task as done
untick task name      # Move task back to Not Done
remove task name      # Delete a task
exit                  # Save and quit
